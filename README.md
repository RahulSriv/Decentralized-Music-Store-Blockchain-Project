# Decentralized-Music-Store-Blockchain-Project

A basic implementation of a decentralized platform consisting of artists or musicians and the audience 
where the musicians can share there work directly to the audience across the decentralized platform doing 
away with the exploitation and revenues of the intermediaries or middlemen involved.

While the number of people accessing and streaming music has gone up exponentially, the industry's revenue 
and the royalty earned by the artist have not increased proportionately. Revenues from album sales, digital 
downloads, streaming services, concert tickets, merchandise, and other sources get divided among the 
intermediate players. Also, revenues are divided in ways that lack transparency and leave little for the 
recording artists. We thus see that the current royalty distribution system is outdated, unreliable and does 
not prioritize the artist.
