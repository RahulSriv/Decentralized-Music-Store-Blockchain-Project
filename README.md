# Decentralized-Music-Store-Blockchain-Project

A basic implementation of a decentralized platform consisting of artists or musicians and the audience 
where the musicians can share there work directly to the audience across the decentralized platform doing 
away with the exploitation and revenues of the intermediaries or middlemen involved.

While the number of people accessing and streaming music has gone up exponentially, the industry's revenue 
and the royalty earned by the artist have not increased proportionately. Revenues from album sales, digital 
downloads, streaming services, concert tickets, merchandise, and other sources get divided among the 
intermediate players. Also, revenues are divided in ways that lack transparency and leave little for the 
recording artists. We thus see that the current royalty distribution system is outdated, unreliable and does 
not prioritize the artist.

Therefore, a decentralized music sharing platform that is free from intermediaries and middlemen, fair and 
easy to use, a system that gives a greater choice to listeners and fair market value compensation to the 
artists and creators is the solution. This will not only empower and encourage small artists but also 
create a new paradigm shift in the way people listen to and pay for music and this can be achieved by the 
creation of blockchain-powered music streaming platforms.
